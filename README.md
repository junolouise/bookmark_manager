# Bookmark Manager

This week, you will build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

## How to use SQL queries

2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager
3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;

## How to set up the test database
